# Lab 2: Julia Data Handling

**Date:** September 5, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 2

## Overview

This lab focuses on mastering essential data handling and visualization skills in Julia. Students will learn to manipulate data with DataFrames.jl, create publication-quality plots with CairoMakie.jl, and perform exploratory data analysis on Texas precipitation datasets.

## Topics Covered

- DataFrames.jl for data manipulation and analysis
- Plotting with CairoMakie.jl for visualization
- Working with TX precipitation datasets
- Basic exploratory data analysis techniques
- Data quality assessment and cleaning

## Objectives

- Master DataFrames.jl for data manipulation and analysis
- Create publication-quality plots with CairoMakie.jl
- Perform exploratory data analysis on Texas precipitation datasets
- Build foundational data analysis skills for statistical modeling

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the data loading, manipulation, and visualization toolkit that students will use for PS1 Tasks 1-3, establishing the computational foundation for rainfall frequency analysis.
